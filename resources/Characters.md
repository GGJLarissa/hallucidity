Character creation basics

## Introduction

Hallucidity handles playable characters and character creation using a minimalistic approach.

Every aspect of a person's abilities ends up being a manifestation of their mind, body or both. These two factors are reduced to a pair of base scores, which in turn account for the character's capacity to endure events that strain their mental and physical functions.

Not being able to overcome such events successfully, results in suffering the corresponding form of damage and, when the character's capacity is exceeded, their physical death or mental breakdown.

A character may belong to one of three classes, which affect their aptitude in receiving physical or mental strain accordingly.

## Base Abilities

### Endurance

Endurance measures the character's ability to receive physical strain. Physical injuries, the feeling of pain, the ability to breath, see and utilise human senses in general, all depend on the character's endurance.

### Intellect

Intellect expresses the character's mental capabilities and cognitive limits. It is a combination of both intelligence and composure, as it reflects the character's ability to accomplish difficult mental feats, to reason and keep hold of the concepts of reality and fantasy at any time.

### Statistics

* Ability score: **max(3d6, 6)**
* Ability modifier: **-1 (1-6), 0 (7-12), +1 (12-18)**
* Hit points: **max(4d6 + Endurance Modifier * 1d6, 8)**
* Sanity points: **max(4d6 + Intellect Modifier * 1d6, 8)**

### Dealing with physical and mental strain

Physical injuries can be treatable. Light injuries may be handled with common items found in a first aid kit, more severe ones may be temporarily managed if a character has the intellectual ability (knowledge) to treat them. The amount of hit points recovered from first aid supplies is defined by rolling **1d6 + Ability Score(s) modifiers**.

Mental symptoms however, require medication in order to be contained. Such medication is not commonly available and can be sought out in medical bays, hospitals and specialized health facilities. Taking such powerfull medication restores **4 sanity points per use**, but directly affects the character's physical condition, as they become lethargic for a while. Mental health patients may also benefit from peaceful sleep.

### Medical Conditions

Upon creating a character, a player must roll **1d6** to determine whether or not they suffer from a medical condition, which may affect them during gameplay. Rolls of **1-3** mean that the character does not have a condition, whereas rolls of **4-6** require an additional **1d6** roll to determine the type of condition.

Conditions:
* Claustrophobia (roll of **1-2**)
* Asthma (roll of **3-4**)
* Visual impairment (roll of **5-6**)

A character may not develop a new condition during the narrative.

### Dealing with known medical condition

Once a character is aware of suffering from one of the medical conditions of the previous section, they must use the necessary medication to avoid side effects and the deterioration of their health.

**Claustrophobic** patients must have access to anti-anxiety medication in order to deal with panic attacks caused by extremely isolated or cluttered environments or suffer **1d6 + Intellect modifier** sanity point damage.

**Asthma** patients must keep an inhaler near them at all times, since the inability to breathe properly during asthma attacks will cause **1d6 + Endurance modifier**.

**Visually impaired** patients must be careful not to lose their glasses/contact lenses or any other visual aid they may be using, since they are practically blind without them. Not being able to see can cause hallucinations in dim light conditions, thus causing **(1d6 / 2) + Intellect modifier** sanity point loss. Cerebral strain eventually tires the character physically, causing an additional **(1d6 / 2) + Endurance modifier** hit point loss.

## Classes

A player character may belong to **one** of the following classes:

### Mechanic

The Mechanic operates heavy machinery on a daily basis, under conditions that test the human body. Thus, manual labor makes the Mechanic able to withstand physical strain more effectively than other classes.

However, not being involved in demanding mental activities makes the Mechanic more susceptible to failing in handling trials of the mind.

Ability score modifiers: **+2 Endurance / -1 Intellect**

### Engineer

The Engineer fulfills a role that requires both their physical and mental capabilities to be on par. The Engineer is a problem solver, a person that can both think of and design solutions, but also able to get their hands dirty and implement them.

Though, a jack of all trades is a master of none!

Ability score modifiers: **+1 Endurance / +1 Intellect**

### Researcher

The Researcher is someone who has dedicated their life in the pursuit of knowledge and evolution of the mind. Researchers push the boundaries of scientific progress and pull the rest of the world ahead with them.

As a result, their mental capabilities are augmented, though this has taken a toll on their physical condition.

Ability score modifiers: **-1 Endurance / +2 Intellect**

## Actions

Actions are considered all character attempts to interact with their environment, e.g. to lift an obstacle, to see in dim light, to operate a machine etc.

Some actions test only the character's physical skill, some only their noetic abilities, some require both mind and body capacity to be performed.

Action roll: **1d6 + Ability score(s) modifier**

Successful actions require a dice roll equal to or higher than their challenge rating.

Note that the action roll above applies to most standard actions, which an average human being is expected to be able to perform. Attempting to perform extraordinary feats may alter the success conditions and may also be affected by other factors as well, which will be pointed out by the narrator.

## Equipment

During their struggle for survival, player characters may use many different items to help them overcome obstacles and move out of harm's way. They are able to carry some of them, or briefly interact with items in their surroundings, either mounted at a fixed location, or disposable.

Characters can only carry as many items as their clothing/accessories and physical ability allow them to. If a character does not carry a case or backpack, they are able to have only a limited number of small items and/or wearable items (pens, screwdrivers, gas masks etc).

Keep in mind that the shape and weight of such items cannot be unreasonable, e.g. a character cannot possibly carry an anvil in their pockets!

Characters are also able to combine compatible items or create new ones, depending on their intellectual or physical ability per case.
