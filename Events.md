# Events

Pushing the game forward

## Introduction

Events are the driving force behind game progression. They introduce disruptive circumstances in the narrative and force players to rethink and adjust their actions.

Some events may prove catastrophic to certain player characters, while, for others, an event could prove deus ex machina. A character's class affects their ability to overcome the event to some extent, but the decisive factor is a player's competence to take advantage of their surroundings and think out of the box.

An event may or may not affect all characters, depending on its purpose in the narrative. Some events may be triggered only by a character's current state of mind or physical condition, others may be large scale events, that inevitably have consequences on the whole game world.

## Event Resolution

Resolving an event is different for each character and is based upon two parameters:

1. Their Endurance/Intellect scores and their current Hit/Sanity points
2. Their ability to improvise and utilise their environment in a realistic and meaningful way, by performing actions

## Timed Events

Timed events take place in **real time**. Such events require resolution within a specific time window, e.g. a character's ability to hold their breath, a countdown etc.
