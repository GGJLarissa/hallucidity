Character creation basics

## Introduction

Hallucidity handles playable characters and character creation using a minimalistic approach.

Every aspect of a person's abilities ends up being a manifestation of their mind, body or both. These two factors are reduced to a pair of base scores, which in turn account for the character's capacity to endure events that strain their mental and physical functions.

Not being able to overcome such events successfully, results in suffering the corresponding form of damage and, when the character's capacity is exceeded, their physical death or mental breakdown.

A character may belong to one of three classes, which affect their aptitude in receiving physical or mental strain accordingly.

## Base Abilities

### Endurance

Endurance measures the character's ability to receive physical strain. Physical injuries, the feeling of pain, the ability to breath, see and utilise human senses in general, all depend on the character's endurance.

### Intellect

Intellect expresses the character's mental capabilities and cognitive limits. It is a combination of both intelligence and composure, as it reflects the character's ability to accomplish difficult mental feats, to reason and keep hold of the concepts of reality and fantasy at any time.

### Statistics

* Ability score: **max(3d6, 6)**
* Ability modifier: **-1 (1-6), 0 (7-12), +1 (12-18)**
* Hit points: **max(4d6 + Endurance Modifier * 1d6)**
* Sanity points: **max(4d6 + Intellect Modifier * 1d6)**

### Medical Conditions

Upon creating a character, a player must roll **1d6** to determine whether or not they suffer from a medical condition, which may affect them during gameplay. Rolls of **1-3** mean that the character does not have a condition, whereas rolls of **4-6** require an additional **1d6** roll to determine the type of condition.

Conditions:
* Claustrophobia (roll of **1-2**)
* Asthma (roll of **3-4**)
* Visual impairment (roll of **5-6**)

A character may not develop a new condition during the narrative.

## Classes

A player character may belong to **one** of the following classes:

### Mechanic

The Mechanic operates heavy machinery on a daily basis, under conditions that test the human body. Thus, manual labor makes the Mechanic able to withstand physical strain more effectively than other classes.

However, not being involved in demanding mental activities makes the Mechanic more susceptible to failing in handling trials of the mind.

Ability score modifiers: **+2 Endurance / -1 Intellect**

### Engineer

The Engineer fulfills a role that requires both their physical and mental capabilities to be on par. The Engineer is a problem solver, a person that can both think of and design solutions, but also able to get their hands dirty and implement them.

Though, a jack of all trades is a master of none!

Ability score modifiers: **+1 Endurance / +1 Intellect**

### Researcher

The Researcher is someone who has dedicated their life in the pursuit of knowledge and evolution of the mind. Research push the boundaries of scientific progress and pull the rest of the world with them.

As a result, their mental capabilities are augmented, though this has taken its toll on their physical condition.

Ability score modifiers: **-1 Endurance / +2 Intellect**

## Actions

Actions are considered all character attempts to interact with their environment, e.g. to lift an obstacle, to see in dim light, to operate a machine etc.

Some actions test only the character's physical skill, some only their noetic abilities, some require both the mind and body capacity to be performed.

Action roll: **1d6 + Ability score(s) modifier**

Successful actions require a dice roll equal to or higher than their challenge rating.

Note that the action roll above applies to most standard actions, which an average human being is expected to be able to perform. Attempting to perform extraordinary feats may alter the success conditions and may also be affected by other factors as well, which will be pointed out by the narrator.
